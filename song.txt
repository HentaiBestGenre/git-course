All of my friends are starting their lives
While I'm working nights tryna stay alive
I heard my boy just bought his own house
Told me I could crash while I figure it out

Writing music that isn't popular anymore
Drinking by the fire talking 'bout my own desires
I know I'm sounding crazy
Know you think I'm fucking lazy
But you'll never understand
You'll never understand
